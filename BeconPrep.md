### Systems Design Question:
The system design question helps us learn about your process to design highly available and scalable services. Use the whiteboard to describe your view of an overall system architecture to solve the problem, components of this architecture, and data flows between components.

### Example coding question:
“Using input of an array of words, write a function which returns all unique combinations of
words which are anagrams of one-another”

### Example system design question:
“How would you design the service behind Twitter?”
