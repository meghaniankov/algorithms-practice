# Divide & Conquer (D&C) Algorithms

D&C algorithms are recursive algorithms. To solve a problem using D&C, there are two steps:

1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.

## Examples

* Quicksort
* Binary Search
