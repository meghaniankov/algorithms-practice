# Graphs

A graph models a set of connections and is made of nodes and edges.

A node can be directly connected to many other nodes. These nodes are called its neighbors.

## Directed vs Unidrected Graphs

A directed graph shows the direction of relation using arrows. If the arrow points in only one direction between two nodes, node B is the neighbor of node A but not the other way around. Two arrows between the nodes shows that they are both each others neighbors. 

An undirected graph doesn't have any arrows and both nodes are each other's neighbors.

## BFS vs DFS

BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.
