# System Design

1. Optimize procedures and increase throughput with the same resources => Vertical Scaling
2. Preparing beforehand during non-peak hours => Preproccessing & cron job?
3. Keep backups and avoid single points of failure => Backups
4. Hire more resources => Horizontal Scaling
5. Microservice architechture
6. Distributed Systems (Partitions)
7. Load Balancing => central system to route requests to different servers
8. Seperate systems for seperate tasks => Decoupling concerns 
9. Logging and metrics calculations
10. Extensible

### System Design Concerns
1. Scalability
2. Fault Tolerance
3. Extensibility

### High Level Design vs Low Level Design

- High Level: (see above)
- Low Level: classes/methods/objects/etc (the code)
