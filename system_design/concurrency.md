# Concurrency

[Concurrency/Multithreading Basics](https://www.callicoder.com/java-concurrency-multithreading-basics/)

The ability of different parts of the program, algo, or problem, to be executed out-of-order or in a particular order, without affecting the final outcome.

This allows for parallel execution of concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of execution.

Concurrency happens when multiple copies of the same program are run at the same time and in the course of their execution, communicate with each other. 

## Concurrent Programming


## Concurrent Systems

Concurrent systems (OS, DB management systems) are designed to operate indefinitely, including automatic recovery from failure
